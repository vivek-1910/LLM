UE23AM342BB2 : Large Language Models and Their Applications
1. Build an ANN classifier to solve classification problems. Use keras
library to build it in python. Use suitable data set from some source
(.csv file). There are two parts to it
a. Solve a binary classification problem
b. Solve a multi class classification problem, where you will be
using softmax at output layer.
After building the model using the process you learned in ML, do a
measurement of the performance using metrics you studied. Use
python appropriate libraries.
Revise the NN material sent (or the chapter 4 and 6 in the book) to
revise concepts. You can get some hints from this link.

2. Solve a logistic regression problem
• Choose different data sest for all the three. .csv files
• Read and understand parameters of the functions you use
• Should be able to explain every line of code clearly.
CNN is removed from what I told in the class.
Evaluation: You need to show it executed on your laptop and answer viva
questions individually.
